# Scalaworks
A translation of parts of the FRCSteamworks code into the Scala programming language.

This project, while done for my own enjoyment, bears the hope that some future 1100 programmer will take it upon themselves to write 
a large portion of the robot code in Scala.

The FRC-SBT plugin I am using can be found here: https://github.com/Team846/sbt-frc
